/**
 * A Generic Reflection Library.
 * *
 * One technique to minimize the use of unchecked casts is to encapsulate these within a library.
 * @see chapter07.section04.GenericReflection
 * *
 * As an example of the use: {@link chapter07.section04.UseGenericReflectionLibrary}
 * *
 * In general, we recommend that if you need to use unchecked casts
 * then you should encapsulate them into a small number of library methods, as we’ve done here.
 * Don’t let unchecked code proliferate through your program!
