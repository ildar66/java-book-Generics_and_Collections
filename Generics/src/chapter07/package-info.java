/**
 * Reflection.
 * *
 * Reflection is the term for a set of features that allows a program to examine its own definition.
 * *
 * Reflection has two important ways:
 * 1) "Generics for reflection" we mean that some of the types used for reflection are now generic types (Class becomes the generic class Class<T>);
 * 2) "Reflection for generics" we mean that reflection now returns information about generic types.
