/**
 * Legacy Library with Generic Client.
 * *
 * Makes sense to update the library to use parameterized types in its method signatures, but not to change the method bodies.
 * There are three ways to do this:
 * by making minimal changes to the source,
 * by creating stub files,
 * or by use of wrappers.
 * *
 * We recommend use of minimal changes when you have access to source and use of stubs when you have access only to class files,
 * and we recommend against use of wrappers.
