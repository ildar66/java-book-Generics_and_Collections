/**
 * Evolution, Not Revolution.
 * *
 * This chapter shows how to add generics to existing code;
 * it considers a small example, a library for stacks that extends the Collections Framework, together with an associated client.
 * *
 * Three ways to do this: minimal changes to the source, stub files, and wrappers.
 * The first is useful when you have access to the source and the second when you do not; we recommend against the third.
