/**
 * How to Define ArrayList.
 * *
 * We have argued elsewhere that it is usually preferable to use a list than to use an array.
 * In rare circumstances, you will need to use an array for reasons of efficiency or compatibility.
 * *
 * @see chapter06.section07.ArrayListTest
 * ArrayList here is close to the actual definition in the source released by Sun.
 * Second way: declare the private array to have type Object[] and use casts to type (E) when retrieving elements from the array.
