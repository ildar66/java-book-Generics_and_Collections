/**
 * Foreach.
 * *
 * The foreach loop can be applied to any object that implements the interface Iterable<E> ({@link java.lang.Iterable}),
 * which in turn refers to the interface Iterator<E> ({@link java.util.Iterator}).
 * *
 * All collections, sets, and lists in the Collections Framework implement the Iterable<E> interface;
 * and classes defined by other vendors or users may implement it as well.
