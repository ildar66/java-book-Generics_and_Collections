/**
 * Wildcards with extends.

 * The question mark is called a wildcard: {@link chapter02.section02.WildcardsWithExtends}.
 * *
 * In general, if a structure contains elements with a type of the form ? extends E,
 * we can get elements out of the structure, but we cannot put elements into the structure.
 * To put elements into the structure we need another kind of wildcard, as explained in the next section.
