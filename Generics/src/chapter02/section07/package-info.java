/**
 * Wildcard Capture.
 * *
 * When a generic method is invoked, the type parameter may be chosen to match the unknown type represented by a wildcard.
 * @see chapter02.section07.WildcardCapture#reverse(java.util.List)
 * Here we say that the type variable T has captured the wildcard.
 * *
 * This is a generally useful technique when dealing with wildcards, and it is worth knowing.
