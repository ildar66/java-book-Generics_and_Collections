/**
 * Implementing {@link java.util.List}.
 * *
 * There are three concrete implementations of List in the Collections Framework,
 * differing in how fast they perform the various operations defined by the interface and how they behave in the face of concurrent modification;
 * unlike {@link java.util.Set} and {@link java.util.Queue}, however, {@link java.util.List} has no subinterfaces to specify differences in
 * functional behavior.
 * *
 * In this and the following section we look at each implementation in turn and provide a performance comparison.
