/**
 * Generic Algorithms.
 * *
 * The generic algorithms fall into four major categories:
 * changing element order in a list,
 * changing the contents of a list,
 * finding extreme values in a collection,
 * and finding specific values in a list.
 * They represent reusable functionality, in that they can be applied to Lists (or in some cases to Collections) of any type.
 * Generifying the types of these methods has led to some fairly complicated declarations,
 * so each section discusses the declarations briefly after presenting them.
