/**
 * The Collections Class.
 * *
 * The class java.util.Collections consists entirely of static methods that operate on or return collections.
 * There are three main categories:
 * * generic algorithms,
 * * methods that return empty or pre-populated collections,
 * * and methods that create wrappers.
 * We discuss these three categories in turn, followed by a number of other methods which do not fit into a neat classification.
 * All the methods of Collections are public and static, so for readability we will omit these modifiers from the individual declarations.
