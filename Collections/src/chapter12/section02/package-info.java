/**
 * Implementing Collection.
 * *
 * There are no concrete implementations of {@link java.util.Collection}.
 * The class {@link java.util.AbstractCollection}, which partially implements it, is one of a series of skeletal implementations —
 * including {@link java.util.AbstractSet}, {@link java.util.AbstractList}, and so on —
 * which provide functionality common to the different concrete implementations of each interface.
 * These skeletal implementations are available to help the designer of new implementations of the Framework interfaces.
 * *
 * For example, {@link java.util.Collection} could serve as the interface for bags (unordered lists),
 * and a programmer implementing bags could extend {@link java.util.AbstractCollection} and find most of the implementation work already done.
