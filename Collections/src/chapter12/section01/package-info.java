/**
 * Using the Methods of Collection.
 * *
 * To illustrate the use of the collection classes, letâ€™s construct a tiny example.
 * @see chapter12.section01.Task
 * We only require four operations on tasks: equals, compareTo, hashCode and toString.
 * Equality will be used to test whether a collection contains a given task,
 * comparison will be used by ordered collections (such as OrderedSet and OrderedMap)
 * and the hash code will be used by collections based on hash tables (such as HashSet and HashMap),
 * and the string representation of a task will be used whenever we show the contents of a collection.
